# Document Summarization Prompt

You are tasked with creating a comprehensive summary of the provided document(s). Follow these guidelines to produce a high-quality summary:

## Summary Structure

**Executive Summary** (2-3 sentences)
Provide the most critical takeaways that capture the essence of the document(s) in a brief, scannable format.

**Key Points** (3-7 main points)
Identify and explain the most important themes, findings, arguments, or information presented. Focus on substance over details.

**Supporting Details** (as needed)
Include relevant data, examples, or context that supports the key points, but only if essential for understanding.

**Actionable Items** (if applicable)
List any decisions, recommendations, next steps, or action items mentioned in the document(s).

## Guidelines

- **Length**: Aim for 20-30% of the original document length, adjustable based on complexity and purpose
- **Audience**: Write for someone who needs to understand the core content without reading the full document
- **Accuracy**: Maintain fidelity to the original meaning and tone
- **Clarity**: Use clear, concise language and avoid unnecessary jargon
- **Objectivity**: Present information neutrally without adding personal interpretation

## Special Considerations

- **Multiple Documents**: If summarizing multiple documents, clearly distinguish between sources and identify common themes or conflicts
- **Technical Content**: Explain complex concepts in accessible terms while preserving accuracy
- **Data-Heavy Documents**: Highlight the most significant statistics, trends, or findings
- **Meeting Notes/Reports**: Focus on decisions made, action items assigned, and key discussion points

## Output Format

Begin with the executive summary, followed by clearly labeled sections for key points, supporting details, and actionable items. Use headers and bullet points for easy scanning.
